          <p><em>Technology and Maths Specialist Teacher</em></p>
          <p>Based in Tokyo, I am an international educator passionate about both mathematics and technology.
          I am currently working towards creating educational apps as I navigate learning Python, HTML, CSS and C# <br>
          Also, I have been recently concentrating on enriching and accelerating students in mathematics, with a focus on combining computational thinking and maths.<br>
           I also have dabbled in, fairly unsuccessfully, machine learning. This website, whilst very simple, is my first ever website produced entirely from HTML</p></td>
